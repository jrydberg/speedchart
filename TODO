* move Dataset.getPreferredRangeAxisInterval to GraphUiProps

* rewrite and simplify the domain axis

* rewrite and simplify the range axis

 * should we have the values inside the graph like chronoscope
   does?

* get rid of Tuple2D and introduce a DataPoint class that
  has a domain and a single range value.

* get rid of the "multiple range tuples" in datasets.
 
* Timeline Model:
 
 * ChartUiProps should have a "minimum resolution", that sets the
   min width of the domain window.

* Fix visual range for area chart; there is some bug there.
 
 * Calculate interval from final planning?
