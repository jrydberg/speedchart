* move Dataset.getPreferredRangeAxisInterval to GraphUiProps

* rewrite and simplify the domain axis

* implement a simple range axis
 
 * should we have the values inside the graph like chronoscope
   does?

* get rid of Tuple2D and introduce a DataPoint class that
  has a domain and a single range value.

 
* Timeline Model:
 
 * CrahUiProps should have a "minimum resolution", that sets the
   min width of the domain window.
